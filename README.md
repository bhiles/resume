# My Resume

It's a single HTML file, with styling included.

The style is extracted from the [short JSON Resume theme](https://github.com/isnotahippy/jsonresume-theme-short).  I originally tried to use [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org) but ran into difficulties since a specific JSON schema is required and it didn't allow for additional sections to be added to the resume, like a "Non-Career Experiences" section. 

To convert the HTML to PDF follow these instructions (which were adapted from [here](http://www.guidingtech.com/7566/chrome-print-to-pdf-convert-webpage-to-pdf/))

* Open the HTML file in Chrome
* File -> Print
* Destination -> Change -> Save as PDF
* Uncheck "Headers and Footers”
* Save
